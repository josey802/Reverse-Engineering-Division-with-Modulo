#  Reverse Engineering Division with Modulo

Most people know `%` as the operator that gives the remainder…  
But what if I told you it can also be used to **reconstruct the original divisor**? 🤯  

This project demonstrates how modulo, quotient, and remainder work together — and shows the neat formula to recover the divisor from them.

## What This Project Covers
- Understanding how **modulo (%)** works  
- Breaking down division into **quotient + remainder**  
- Using a clean formula to **reverse engineer the divisor**

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
Modulo isn’t just an abstract math trick — it’s everywhere in computer science and tech:  

- **Cryptography ** – modular arithmetic is the backbone of RSA and many encryption algorithms.  
- **Hashing Functions ** – remainders are used to map large values into fixed-size buckets (like in hash tables).  
- **Scheduling & Cycles ** – calculating days of the week, repeating patterns, or round-robin tasks.  
- **Game Development ** – keeping player positions, scores, or events within fixed ranges.  
- **Data Compression & Error Checking ** – modulo operations help with checksums and detecting errors.
